# userChrome.css

userChrome.css for Mozilla Firefox

# Features

## Close tab buttons hidden

I have a middle click on every PC I use. Removing these buttons reclaims some space.

## Plugin notification bar hidden

I keep Flash Player set to "Ask to Activate". I don't activate it on most pages that request it. The nag bar is annoying since I can click the plugin icon in the Location Bar.

# Installation

Create a ``chrome`` folder in your [profile folder](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder) and copy ``userChrome.css`` into it. For more information, see [userChrome.css on the MozillaZine Knowledge Base](http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&printable=yes).
